# Electron App Template: Angular 2, Typescript and VS Code

This boilerplate is just enough to get you started with making Electron apps!

It's a fork of Auth0's code from their [great tutorial](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/12/15/create-a-desktop-app-with-angular-2-and-electron/) but custom code removed and formatted as a template.

Assumed basic knowledge

- Electron
- Node, npm
- Angular2
- Typescript
- VS Code (optional)
